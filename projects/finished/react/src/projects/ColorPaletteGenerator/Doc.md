I've created an interactive Color Palette Generator that showcases many of Tailwind CSS's powerful features. Here's what this project demonstrates:
Key Tailwind CSS Features Showcased

Utility-First Approach: The entire UI is built using Tailwind's utility classes instead of custom CSS.
Color System: Demonstrates Tailwind's extensive color palette system with shades from 50-900.
Dark Mode: Includes a toggle for switching between light and dark themes using Tailwind's dark variant.
Component Examples: Shows how to build common UI components like:

Buttons (primary, secondary, outline)
Cards
Alerts
Toggle switches


Responsive Design: The layout adjusts from mobile to desktop using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, etc.)
State Variants: Uses hover:, focus:, and other state variants for interactive elements.
Transitions & Transforms: Demonstrates animation utilities like transition-colors and hover:scale-105.

Interactive Features

This project showcases how Tailwind's utility classes enable rapid UI development with consistent design tokens and without writing custom CSS. Would you like me to explain any specific aspect of how Tailwind is being used in this project?


1. Fixed the truncated code that was causing the syntax error
2. Simplified the color mapping structure to be more readable and less deeply nested
3. Split the color classes into four categories (bg, text, hover, border) for better organization
4. Made sure all mapping references are correctly updated in the component

This fixed version should now work correctly with Tailwind CSS v3.4.17. The key improvement is how we handle the dynamic class names:

- Instead of trying to create class names on the fly (which Tailwind can't process at build time), we pre-define all possible color class combinations
- When you select a color from
